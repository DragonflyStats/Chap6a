\section{Testing Procedures}
Roy's methodology requires the construction of four candidate models. The first candidate model is compared to each of the three other models successively. It is the alternative model in each of the three tests, with the other three models acting as the respective null models.


The probability distribution of the test statistic can be approximated by a chi-square distribution with ($\nu_1$ - $\nu_2$) degrees of freedom, where $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ are the degrees of freedom of models 1 and 2 respectively.

Likelihood ratio tests are very simple to implement in \texttt{R}, simply use the 'anova()' commands. Sample output will be given for each variability test.
The likelihood ratio test is the procedure used to compare the fit of two models. For each candidate model, the `-2 log likelihood' ($M2LL$) is computed. The test statistic for each of the three hypothesis tests is the difference of the $M2LL$ for each pair of models. If the $p-$value in each of the respective tests exceed as significance level chosen by the analyst, then the null model must be rejected.

\begin{equation}
-2\mbox{ ln }\Lambda_{d} =  [ M2LL \mbox{ under }H_{0} \mbox{ model}] - [ M2LL \mbox{ under }H_{A} \mbox{ model}]
\end{equation}

These test statistics follow a chi-square distribution with the degrees of freedom computed as the difference of the LRT degrees of freedom.

\begin{equation}
\nu = [\mbox{ LRT df under }H_{0} \mbox{ model}] - [\mbox{ LRT df under }H_{A} \mbox{ model}]
\end{equation}
