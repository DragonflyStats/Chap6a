</code></pre>

#### Arguments 

* ``.data`` a tbl 
* ``...``: Expressions to apply to each group. 
* ``...``: If named, results will be stored in a new column.

If this number is too big, the process will be slow because R has to allocate and free a lot of memory. 
If itâ€™s too small, it will be slow, because of the overhead of talking to the database.
