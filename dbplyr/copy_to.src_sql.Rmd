## ``copy_to.src_sql`` Copy a local data frame to a DBI backend.

#### Description 

This ``copy_to()`` method works for all DBI sources. It is useful for copying small amounts of data to a database for examples, experiments, and joins. By default, it creates temporary tables which are typically only visible to the current connection to the database.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
## S3 method for class 'src_sql' 
copy_to(dest, df, name = deparse(substitute(df)), overwrite = FALSE, types = NULL, 
        temporary = TRUE, unique_indexes = NULL, indexes = NULL, analyze = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments 
* dest remote data source 
* df A local data frame, a tbl_sql from same source, or a tbl_sql from another source. 
 If from another source, all data must transition through R in one pass, so it is only suitable for transferring small amounts of data. name name for new remote table. overwrite If TRUE, will overwrite an existing table with name name. If FALSE, will throw an error if name already exists. types a character vector giving variable types to use for the columns. See http:// www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html for available types.
* temporary if TRUE, will create a temporary table that is local to this connection and will be automatically deleted when the connection expires unique_indexes a list of character vectors. Each element of the list will create a new unique index over the speciÔ¨Åed column(s). Duplicate rows will result in failure. indexes a list of character vectors. Each element of the list will create a new index. analyze if TRUE (the default), will automatically ANALYZE the new table so that the query optimiser has useful information. ... other parameters passed to methods.

 
#### Value 
A ``tbl()`` object (invisibly).

#### Examples
```{r}`
library(dplyr) set.seed(1014)
mtcars$model <- rownames(mtcars) mtcars2 <- src_memdb() %>% copy_to(mtcars, indexes = list("model"), overwrite = TRUE) mtcars2 %>% filter(model == "Hornet 4 Drive")
cyl8 <- mtcars2 %>% filter(cyl == 8) cyl8_cached <- copy_to(src_memdb(), cyl8)
# copy_to is called automatically if you set copy = TRUE # in the join functions df <- tibble(cyl = c(6, 8)) mtcars2 %>% semi_join(df, copy = TRUE)
```
