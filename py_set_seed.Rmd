#### Description 
Set various random seeds required to ensure reproducible results. The provided seed value will
establish a new random seed for Python and NumPy, and will also (by default) disable hash randomization.
#### Usage
py_set_seed(seed, disable_hash_randomization = TRUE)
#### Arguments
* seed A single value, interpreted as an integer

disable_hash_randomization
Disable hash randomization, which is another common source of variable results.
See https://docs.python.org/3.4/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED

Details
This function does not set the R random seed, for that you should call set.seed().
