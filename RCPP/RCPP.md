RCPP
====

The Rcpp package provides R functions as well as a C++ library which facilitate the integration of R and C++. 

The Rcpp package has become the most widely used language extension for R, the powerful environment and language for computing with data. As of early 2013, over 100 packages on CRAN and a further 10 on BioConductor deploy Rcpp to extend R, to accelerate computations and to connect to other C++ projects.
